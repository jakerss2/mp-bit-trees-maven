- **Instructions for use**
  When running, you must give two command line arguments. The first argument specifies what we will be translating to.
  The options are braille, ascii, and unicode. The second argument will be the thing we are translating.
  For example, "java -cp target/classes edu.grinnell.csc207.main.BrailleASCII braille hello" will print
  110010100010111000111000101010
  If you do ascii and the previous number, you will get hello. unicode hello will produce hello as you would see in braille.
